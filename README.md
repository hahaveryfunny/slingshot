# 🎯 Slingshot Game (Unity)

A **complete Unity game** built around a **slingshot-based core mechanic**, progression systems, and a simple economy loop.

This repository contains a **fully playable game**, not a mechanic or tech demo.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

- Slingshot aiming and shooting mechanic  
- Physics-based projectile interactions  
- Multiple object / target types  
- Upgrade and progression system  
- Market-style upgrade UI  
- Designed with mobile-style controls in mind

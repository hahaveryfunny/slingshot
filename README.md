# 🎯 Slingshot Game (Unity)

A **complete mobile-style game** built in Unity, centered around a **slingshot-based core mechanic**, procedural gameplay elements, and progression systems.

This project represents one of my **earlier full game implementations**, where the focus was on **finishing a playable game with multiple interconnected systems**, rather than isolated feature demos.

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

- Slingshot-based aiming and shooting mechanic
- Physics-driven projectile interactions
- Multiple enemy / object types
- Progression through upgrades and unlocks
- Market / upgrade system integrated into gameplay loop
- Designed with mobile-friendly controls in mind

*(Gameplay demo GIF / video can be added here)*

## ✨ Core Systems Implemented

- Slingshot aiming & release mechanic
- Projectile physics and collision handling
- Procedural or semi-procedural level elements
- Upgrade / market system
- Game state management
- Basic progression and replay loop
- UI for gameplay and upgrades

This project was built as a **complete playable experience**, not a single-mechanic prototype.

---

## 🧠 Technical Notes

- Built using **Unity + C#**
- Codebase relies heavily on **Singleton-style managers** for:
  - Game state
  - Player data
  - Progression
  - UI coordination
- Architecture reflects an **earlier design approach**, prior to adopting a more event-driven pattern used in later projects

## ⚖️ Design & Architecture Trade-offs

### Singleton-Based Architecture
**Why it was used**
- Simpler mental model for a first full game
- Faster iteration during early development
- Easy global access to core systems

**Trade-offs**
- Tight coupling between systems
- Harder to test and extend cleanly
- Less flexible than event-driven or decoupled architectures

Later projects in this portfolio move away from this approach in favor of **event-based communication and modular systems**, reflecting an evolution in design practices.

---

## 📌 What This Project Demonstrates

- Ability to **complete a full game**, not just isolated demos
- Implementation of multiple gameplay systems working together
- Understanding of progression, upgrades, and player feedback loops
- Early architectural decisions and **subsequent learning progression**
- Practical Unity development beyond tutorials

---

## 📈 Notes on Progression

This project represents an **earlier stage** in my Unity development.

More recent projects in this portfolio:
- Reduce or eliminate singleton usage
- Use event-driven systems
- Focus on cleaner separation of concerns
- Emphasize reusable gameplay modules

This repository is included to show **end-to-end game completion and growth over time**.
